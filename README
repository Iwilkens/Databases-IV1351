This project is for a course called "Datalagring" and it includes two SQL files. The first file contains SQL statements that create several tables and views in a relational database as per the assignment requirements. The tables include email, instrument, payment, phone_number and student. The views include lesson_and_booking. The script also uses SQL statements to insert data into these tables, set constraints and create ENUM type called skill_level with the values 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced'.

The second file contains SQL statements that perform some more advanced queries on the database as per the assignment requirements. It includes SELECT statements that use JOINs, subqueries, and aggregate functions. It also contains a statement that creates a materialized view called ensemble_next_week. In addition, it contains a statement that performs a VACUUM ANALYZE and one that uses the EXPLAIN command to analyze a SELECT statement.

Overall, this project demonstrates the creation of a relational database with tables, views and use of various SQL statements to query and manipulate the data in these tables as per the assignment requirements for the course "Datalagring".
